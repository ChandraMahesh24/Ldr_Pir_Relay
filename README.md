Controlling bulb. Bulb glows only when motion is detected in night time


  Hardware Supplies:
      
        1. Arduino Uno ( any other arduino board will be just fine as long as it provides an Analogical pin ).
        
        2. PIR Motion Sensor

        3. LDR (Photoresistor)

        4. 10 KOhms resistor

        5. Relay module

        6. led

        7. Breadboard (optional)

   Software Supplies:
        
        1. Arduino IDE
